# Portfolio

This is my custom personal portfolio website which I will use to showcase my personal projects. I made this website from scratch using the Cloud9 IDE with nodeJS and Bootstrap (for styling). 

This website consists of three pages (home, about, projects). Notable features include a pulsing background animation and typeout effect animation on the homepage (made with CSS) as well as a subtle collapsing menu at the top with links to each page.
